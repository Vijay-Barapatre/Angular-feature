Angular Input and Output.
Concept and code explained together — the easy way.

If you understand this pattern,
you understand how Angular components talk — cleanly, safely, and predictably.

Imagine two components — a parent and a child.
By default, they are completely isolated.

The parent has data, like a user name.
But the child cannot see it.

And when the child does something,
the parent doesn’t even know it happened.

So right now, they’re disconnected.
We need a bridge.

Angular gives us that bridge with one simple rule.
Data goes down using Input.
Events go up using Output.

Step one — the child component defines the contract.
What data it expects, and what events it can send.

Here’s the complete picture — child component, parent component, and the template.
Don’t worry about memorizing it.
Let’s understand how it works.

Input means the child expects data from the parent.
The data always flows downward.

Output means the child can notify the parent.
Events always flow upward.

The parent owns the data.
It is the single source of truth.

When an event comes from the child,
the parent decides what to do.

This connection happens in the template.
Square brackets send data down.
Parentheses send events up.

Squares down.
Parentheses up.

When the parent updates data,
Angular automatically pushes it to the child.

The user interacts with the child component.

The child emits an event,
and the parent reacts immediately.

This complete cycle is called unidirectional data flow.
Clear, predictable, and easy to debug.

Never change input data inside the child.
The parent owns it — always.

In modern Angular, we use Signals.
Cleaner syntax, better performance —
but the same exact idea.

Parent owns data.
Child receives data.
Child emits events.
Parent reacts.

If you remember this flow,
Angular communication will never confuse you again.
Happy coding.
