## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Problem: State Management Chaos 🌪️
In large-scale Angular applications, managing state across multiple components becomes difficult:
- **Prop Drilling**: Passing data down multiple levels of components.
- **Inconsistent State**: Two components showing different data for the same entity.
- **Complex Debugging**: Difficult to track why and when the state changed.
- **Tight Coupling**: Components depending directly on each other's state.
- **Boilerplate**: Repetitive logic in services for state updates.

### The Solution: NgRx Store 🏛️
NgRx provides a **Single Source of Truth** and a predictable state container:
- ✅ **Centralized State**: All shared data lives in one place.
- ✅ **Predictability**: State changes only through explicit Actions and pure Reducers.
- ✅ **Decoupling**: Components don't know about each other; they only talk to the Store.
- ✅ **Performance**: Built-in memoization and OnPush change detection friendliness.
- ✅ **Tooling**: Powerful debugging with Redux DevTools.

### Comparison: Component State vs NgRx Store

| Aspect | Component State | NgRx Store |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Scope** | Local to component | Global / Feature-wide |
| **Communication** | @Input / @Output | Selectors / Actions |
| **Predictability** | Low (any method can change) | High (Strict Reducer flow) |
| **Debugging** | Manual console logs | Redux DevTools Time Travel |
| **Persistence** | Lost on navigation | Centralized (Can be synced) |

## 🔍 How It Works

### The Redux Flow
NgRx follows the Redux pattern:
1. **Action**: Describes what happened ("What").
2. **Reducer**: Pure function that updates state ("How").
3. **Selector**: Queries data from store ("Query").
4. **Store**: The database in memory ("Storage").

```

### 🎬 Behind the Scenes: `createReducer` Flow
1. **Initialization**: When app loads, `createReducer` maps Action Types to Handlers.
2. **Registration**: Reducer is registered with `provideStore()`.
3. **Execution**: When an action is dispatched, the Store calls the Reducer with Current State + Action, which returns a **New State** object.

## 🚀 Implementation

### Step 1: Define Actions
```typescript
// store/counter.actions.ts
import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';

export const increment = createAction('[Counter Page] Increment');
export const decrement = createAction('[Counter Page] Decrement');
export const reset = createAction('[Counter Page] Reset');

// Action with payload
export const setCustomValue = createAction(
    '[Counter Page] Set Custom Value',
    props<{ value: number }>()
);
```

### Step 2: Create Reducer
```typescript
// store/counter.reducer.ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { increment, decrement, reset, setCustomValue } from './counter.actions';

export interface CounterState {
    count: number;
}

export const initialState: CounterState = { count: 0 };

export const counterReducer = createReducer(
    initialState,
    on(increment, state => ({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 })),
    on(decrement, state => ({ ...state, count: state.count - 1 })),
    on(reset, state => ({ ...state, count: 0 })),
    on(setCustomValue, (state, { value }) => ({ ...state, count: value }))
);
```

### Step 3: Create Selectors
```typescript
// store/counter.selectors.ts
import { createSelector, createFeatureSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
import { CounterState } from './counter.reducer';

export const selectCounterState = createFeatureSelector<CounterState>('counter');

export const selectCount = createSelector(
    selectCounterState,
    (state) => state.count
);
```

### Step 4: Component Integration
```typescript
// counter.component.ts
@Component({ ... })
export class CounterComponent {
    private store = inject(Store);
    count$ = this.store.select(selectCount);
    
    increment() {
        this.store.dispatch(increment());
    }
}
```

### 🔬 Deep Dive: Factory Functions 🏭
NgRx uses **Factory Functions** (functions that return other functions/objects).
- `createAction()`: Returns an **Action Creator**.
- `createReducer()`: Returns a **Reducer Function**.
- `createSelector()`: Returns a **Memoized Selector**.

## 🗄️ The Restaurant Analogy

Thinking of NgRx as a **Restaurant Operation** makes it easy to remember:

| NgRx Concept | Restaurant Part | Role |
|--------------|-----------------|------|
| **Store** | 🏭 **Kitchen** | The central place where state/food lives. |
| **Action** | 📝 **Order Ticket** | A message saying "Customer wants Pizza" (Source + Event). |
| **Reducer** | 👨‍🍳 **Chef** | Takes ingredients (old state) + order (action) and produces a new dish (new state). |
| **Selector** | 🧑‍🍳 **Waiter** | Fetches the finished dish from the kitchen for the customer. |
| **Effect** | 🚨 **Supplier Run** | If the kitchen is out of cheese, call the supplier (API call). |

> **Key Rule**: The Chef (Reducer) **NEVER** leaves the kitchen and **NEVER** calls suppliers. They only cook (pure functions)!

## 📚 Key Classes & Types

### 1. `Store<T>`
The central service used for dispatching actions and selecting state.
- `dispatch(action)`: Triggers a state change.
- `select(selector)`: Returns an Observable of the requested data.

### 2. `createAction` & `props<T>`
Used to define type-safe action creators. The string must be unique and follows the `[Source] Event` pattern.

### 3. `createReducer` & `on`
Defines how state transitions happen. `on(action, handler)` maps a specific action to a logic block.

### 4. `createSelector` & `createFeatureSelector`
- `createFeatureSelector`: Grabs a slice of top-level state (e.g., 'auth', 'cart').
- `createSelector`: Combines and transforms state slices with memoization.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
Storing the current user, permissions, and tokens. Any component can "Select" the user to show a profile name or check roles.

### 2. **Shopping Cart**
A product page dispatches `addToCart`. The header component selects `cartItems.count` to update the icon badge immediately.

### 3. **Theming & Preferences**
User changes font size or Dark Mode. The update is dispatched to the store and applied globally across all layouts.

### 4. **Complex Dashboards**
Multiple widgets (charts, tables) listening to the same "FinancialData" state slice. When data refills, all widgets update simultaneously.

### 5. **Navigation History**
Storing breadcrumbs or "Recently Viewed Items" into a store slice as the user navigates through the app.
